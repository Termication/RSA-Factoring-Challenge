Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

Usage: factors <file>
where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
One number per line
You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1
You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before and after the valid number
The file will always end with a new line
Output format: n=p*q
one factorization per line
p and q don’t have to be prime numbers

RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that

n = p × q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

This task is the same as task 0, except:

p and q are always prime numbers
There is only one number in the files
